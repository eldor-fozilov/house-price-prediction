## Features of the Project

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Understanding the dataset with descriptive statistics and visualizations.
  - Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations between features.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
  - Standardizing numerical data and encoding categorical features.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Creating new features to enhance predictive performance.
  - Selecting the most relevant features for modeling.

- **Model Selection and Training**:
  - Training multiple machine learning models, such as:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forests
    - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Comparing models using metrics such as:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    - R-squared (RÂ²)

## Dataset

The dataset (`data.csv`) contains various features that describe the attributes of houses and are used to predict their prices. Key features include:

- **Lot Area**: The size of the lot in square feet.
- **Overall Quality**: An overall rating of the material and finish of the house, ranging from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent).
- **Year Built**: The year when the house was originally constructed.
- **Gr Liv Area**: Above-grade (ground) living area in square feet.
- **Neighborhood**: The neighborhood where the house is located.
- **Total Rooms**: The total number of rooms (excluding bathrooms).
- **Garage Area**: The size of the garage in square feet.
- **Sale Type**: The type of sale (e.g., Warranty Deed, Partial).
- **Sale Condition**: The condition of sale (e.g., Normal, Abnormal).

Refer to `data_description.txt` for a comprehensive description of all the features in the dataset.
